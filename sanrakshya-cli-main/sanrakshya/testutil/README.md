# sanrakshya testutils package

These are test functions that are useful for testing sanrakshya and downstream of sanrakshya. There are no API guarantees
for these functions -- they may change at any time. Breaking changes to these functions may occur without
necessarily bumping the major version of sanrakshya or noting the breakage in the release notes.

These functions are only for testing purposes and should not be used in production code.
